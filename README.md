### Game Play

The theme of this game is Avengers. When game is started, you have the option to choose Basic Cards or Cloze Cards. Once you choose, you will be given 10 questions.

Basic Cards have a full question on the front and the answer on the back. If you answer correctly, it moves on to the next question. If you answer incorrectly, it will display the correct answer and then move on to the next question.

Cloze Cards have a partial statement with a word or words replaced with underscores. Like the Basic Cards game, if you answer correctly, it moves on to the next question. If you answer incorrectly, it will display the correct answer and then move on to the next question.

At the end of each game, your score will display. Then you are asked if you want to play again. If you choose yes, you get to choose which game to play again. If you choose no, the game will end and the command prompt will reappear.
